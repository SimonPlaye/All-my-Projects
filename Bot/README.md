Contrary to my "Instagram Bot" this project went further. Here my goal was to automatize the creation of bots that would "Like" tweets and "Follow" users.
Thus, this project can be divided between:
- a part that aims to automatize the creation of the bot (create an username, a false email address and click on the
link to activate the account...)
- another that controls the bot on Twitter and that can like/follow

I didn't use the Twitter API because I didn't know it existed. Furthermore, this program is highly under-optimized. Using Selenium makes it not realistically
usuable. Besides, I never managed to automatize the creation of bots because Twitter blocked me by using Captcha. Nevertheless, it was good playing with scrapping
libraries and seeing my bot clicking on tweets for hours.
